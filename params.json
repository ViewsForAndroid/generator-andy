It's not finished and stable by any means, so expect a lot of bugs and nasty things! You've been warned, pal!**\r\n\r\nLet's think about how we start a new Android project:\r\n\r\n1. Open Android Studio.\r\n2. Fill the fields (application name, package name…)\r\n3. Select what support libraries do you want.\r\n4. Wait 'till Android Studio indexes everything.\r\n5. Start editing `build.gradle` to add dependencies, then your custom deploy code and configurations (and scratch your head thinking why some things don't work as expected!)…\r\n6. Start coding!\r\n\r\n**Introducing… ANDY!**\r\n\r\nAndy helps you to quickly create a **well configured, well behaved** Android application (and project libraries too!). It's the spiritual successor to [Android KickstartR](http://androidkickstartr.com/) project but updated to the modern times!\r\n\r\nWith Andy you have *de facto* the following features:\r\n\r\n* It will download automatically all required `SDKs` and `Support Libraries` as necessary because it's configured to use the great [`SDK Manager Plugin`](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin) written by the brave and the bold [Jake Warthon](https://github.com/JakeWharton)!\r\n* It will create automatically all `androidTest`, `debug` and `release` directories! And… as it creates an `androidTest` directory, it includes `Expresso` by default!\r\n* It creates a `version.properties` file to update your app version easily!\r\n* It configures `gradle` to display a dialog (or password prompt) when signing your application (as [Tim Rodes has described in this great post](https://www.timroes.de/2014/01/19/using-password-prompts-with-gradle-build-files/)!).\r\n* It enables by default the `gradle daemon` to speed things up when compiling from terminal (Android Studio enables this by default).\r\n* It generates a properly `.gitignore` file.\r\n* More to come!\r\n\r\nAndy is built using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), a fantastic tool for creating scaffolds for Web and whatever application you could imagine of!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nAs Andy is a Yeoman plugin, it's mandatory to install first Yeoman if you didn't do it before:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g yo\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the step before is finished, you can install Andy properly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g generator-andy\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCreate a new directory where you want to put your application code and `cd` into it, then call Andy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yo andy\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Generators\r\n\r\nBy default Andy includes two generators:\r\n\r\n* [android:app](#app)\r\n* [android:library](#library)\r\n\r\n### App\r\n\r\nFinish this section!\r\n\r\n### Library\r\n\r\nNot developed yet!\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things to do, but for now the most important ones are:\r\n\r\n* Finish current iteration for generating a complete application project.\r\n* Write the library generator and make it composable with the app generator.\r\n* Write properly tests!\r\n* …\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nPull requests and issues are very welcome! Keep in mind that main development is done in the `develop` branch!\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis project is partially inspired by the work done by [Groupsky](https://github.com/groupsky) who started his own [`generator-android`](https://github.com/groupsky/generator-android/) project.\r\n\r\n## Creator\r\n\r\nAldo Borrero González – aldo@aldoborrero.com\r\n\r\n* [@aldoborrero](https://twitter.com/aldoborrero)\r\n* [+AldoBorrero](https://plus.google.com/+AldoBorrero)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nAndy source code is released under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
